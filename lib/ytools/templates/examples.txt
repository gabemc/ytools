Assuming a YAML file like the following:

---
this:
    is: 
        - a
        - very
        - simple
    yaml: file
    but: It's
    pretty:
        easy: 42
        to-read: 'right?'
---

You can then create a template to access these values:

---
You can write out <%= this.is[0] %> simple template
<%= this.yaml %> that uses the YAML as its bound object.
It's fairly straight forward, <%= this.pretty['to-read']%>
---

It would output:

---
You can write out a simple template
file that uses the YAML as its bound object.
It's fairly straight forward, right?
---

You can, of course use all of the syntax available
in a regular ERB template so you could do something 
like:

---
<% 0.upto(this.pretty.easy) do |i| %>
   <% if i == 42 %>
      The secret of the universe is <%= i %>!
      <%= this.but %> <%= this.is[2] %> <%= this.is[3] %>
      <%= this.pretty['to-read'] %>
   <% end %>
<% end %>
---

That would output:

---
The secret of the universe is 42!
It's very simple
right?
