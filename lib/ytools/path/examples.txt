Examples
--------

Something like XPath, we use dotted expressions to pull out
specific configuration values.

The path expression have a particular syntax:

- YAML hashes are accessed using the '/' syntax, so 
     ---
     this:
        goes: here
     ---
  would access the value 'here' with the expression '/this/goes'.

  If the key itself has '/' characters, wrap the key in '|'s, so
     ---
     this/is/complex:
        goes: here
     ---
  would access the value 'here' with the expression 
  '/|this/is/complex|/goes'.  The '|' can be escaped with '\|'

- Array values can be specified by index so
     ---
     this:
        - is a list
        - of values
     ---
  would access the 2nd array value 'of values' with the 
  expression '/this[1]'

- If you want all of the values in a list, each value on a
  separate line,
     ---
     this:
        - name: joe
          age: 32
        - name: jack
          age: 10
     ---
  would access all of ages could be accessed by '/this[]/age'
  and would return:

     32
     10

- If you want all the keys in a hash, each key on a 
  separate line,
     ---
     this:
        host1:
           value: blip
        host2:
           value: bloom
        host3:
           value: blam
     ---
  you would access 'host[1-3]' with the expression '/this@'.

- If you have non-standard keys in any way, you can wrap them,
  so, more complicated formats like
     ---
     this is a complex:
        'and@!pretty':
           'funky!': system of government
     ---
  You would access the 'system of government' value in the 
  document with '/@['this is a complex']/@['and@!pretty']/@['funky!']'
  
Caveats
-------
Missing elements output nothing.  Malformed path expressions
print an error and exit 1.
