   Examples
   --------

   Something like XPath, we use dotted expressions to pull out
   specific configuration values.

   The path expression have a particular syntax:

   - YAML hashes are accessed using the '.' syntax, so 
     ---
     this:
        goes: here
     ---
     would access the value 'here' with the expression 'this.goes'.

     If the key itself has '.' characters, wrap the key in '|'s, so
     ---
     this.is.complex:
        goes: here
     ---
     would access the value 'here' with the expression 
     '|this.is.complex|.goes'

   - Array values can be specified by index so
     ---
     this:
        - is a list
        - of values
     ---
     would access the 2nd array value 'of values' with the 
     expression 'this[1]'

   - If you want all of the values in a list, each value on a
     separate line,
     ---
     this:
        - name: joe
          age: 32
        - name: jack
          age: 10
     ---
     would access all of ages could be accessed by 'this[].age'
     and would return:

     32
     10

   - If you want all the keys in a hash, each key on a 
     separate line,
     ---
     this:
        host1:
           value: blip
        host2:
           value: bloom
        host3:
           value: blam
     ---
     you would access 'host[1-3]' with the expression 'this'.

   Missing elements output nothing.  Malformed path expressions
   print an error and exit 1.
